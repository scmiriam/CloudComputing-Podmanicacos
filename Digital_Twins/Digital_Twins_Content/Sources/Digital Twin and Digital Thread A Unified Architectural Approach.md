# [Source] - Digital Twin System Interoperability Framework | DTC

## Source Summary
An authoritative technical framework published in December 2021 by the Digital Twin Consortium (DTC)—an open standards program of the Object Management Group (OMG)—codifying the systemic requirements for interoperability, lifecycle data integration, and the functional relationship between the **Digital Twin** and the **Digital Thread**:

1. **Foundational Consensus Definition:**
   - Formalizes the DTC industry-standard definition: a Digital Twin is an integrated virtual representation of real-world entities and processes that synchronizes at a **"specified frequency and fidelity."**
   - Clarifies that physical-virtual synchronization does not mandate universal microsecond latency; rather, update rates and modeling depth must be deliberately engineered to match the physics, risk profile, and analytical requirements of the target operational use case.

2. **Functional Division of Architectural Roles:**
   - **Digital Twin (Vertical Operational Depth):** Operates at the runtime layer, executing dynamic physics models, telemetry-driven state evaluation, predictive health diagnostics, and closed-loop control on a specific physical asset, system, or localized operational process.
   - **Digital Thread (Horizontal Lifecycle Breadth):** Functions as the authoritative communications spine and data lineage fabric across the enterprise, maintaining continuous digital traceability across historically isolated domains—from initial requirements and CAD engineering through supply chain procurement, shop-floor manufacturing, maintenance logs, and end-of-life disposal.

3. **Interoperability & Closed-Loop Synergy:**
   - **Thread-to-Twin Ingestion:** Supplies the Digital Twin with definitive "as-designed" and "as-built" configuration metadata (including serial-specific material properties, tolerance deviations, and sensor calibration offsets), ensuring virtual simulations run on true-to-build parameters rather than nominal assumptions.
   - **Twin-to-Thread Feedback:** Operational anomalies, runtime telemetry trends, and degradation histories computed during in-service operation flow back into the Digital Thread, directly informing next-generation engineering prototypes, supplier quality audits, and enterprise-wide resource planning.
